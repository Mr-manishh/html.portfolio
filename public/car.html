<h2>PORSCHE 918 SPYDER</h2>
<p>The Porsche 918 Spyder is a sports car manufactured by German marque Porsche.[5] The 918 Spyder is a plug-in hybrid powered by a mid-mounted naturally aspirated 4.6 L (4,593 cc) V8 engine, developing 447 kW (608 PS; 599 hp) at 8,700 RPM, with two electric motors delivering an additional 210 kW (286 PS; 282 hp) for a combined output of 652 kW (875 hp) and 1,280 N⋅m (944 lbf⋅ft) of torque.[6][7] The 918 Spyder's 6.8 kWh lithium-ion battery pack delivers an all-electric range of 19 km (12 mi) under the US Environmental Protection Agency's five-cycle tests.[2]

  Production began on 18 September 2013, with deliveries initially scheduled to begin in December 2013, and a starting price of ≈€781,000 (US$845,000 or £711,000).[8][9][10] The 918 Spyder was sold out in December 2014 and production ended in June 2015.[11]
  
  The 918 Spyder was first shown as a concept at the 80th Geneva Motor Show in March 2010.[8] On 28 July 2010, after 2,000 declarations of interest, the supervisory board of Porsche AG approved series development of the 918 Spyder.[12] The production version was unveiled at the September 2013 Frankfurt Motor Show.[13] Porsche also unveiled the RSR racing variant of the 918 at the 2011 North American International Auto Show, which combines hybrid technology first used in the 997 GT3 R Hybrid, with styling from the 918 Spyder.[14] However, the 918 RSR didn't make it to production. The 918 Spyder was the second plug-in hybrid car manufactured by Porsche, after the 2014 Panamera S E-Hybrid.</p>
